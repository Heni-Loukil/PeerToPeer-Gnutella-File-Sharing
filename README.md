# PeerToPeer-Gnutella-File-Sharing
To run The project on your personal device first of all you need to open cmd and navigate to the path where this project exists :
example : cd //........../Project
To run each peer you use the command : Java -jar GnutellaNetwork.jar startopology.txt /*node number*/ /*Path of the project*//peer1/*maybe 2 or 3 or 4*/
NB: You have to run all the 9 Peers in order to establish connectivity between them, One peer missing breaks the whole network
-> You can add files in each peer file 
-> You choose 1 if you want to download a file from another peer.
-> You choose 2 if you want to notice other peers that a notification happened to a file they got.
